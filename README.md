# ArtisanKart Website

## Overview

We have successfully implemented the **ArtisanKart** website along with the **artisan portal** to manage orders, deliveries, and payments. Artisans can list their products through the portal, and these products will automatically appear on the main website. This unique integration is a key feature of our platform. The backend has been successfully implemented to support these functionalities.
